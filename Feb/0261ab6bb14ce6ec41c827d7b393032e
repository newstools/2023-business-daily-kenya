FILE PHOTO | NMG Former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga's term as the African Union special envoy for infrastructure development has ended following the set up of an agency to take over the continental mandate. Mr Odinga was appointed as the High Representative for Infrastructure in Africa on October 20, 2018, during the leadership of retired President Uhuru Kenyatta. The African Union is seeking to expedite the integration of the continent through infrastructure, to promote economic growth and sustainable development. "The transformation of the Nepad Agency to African Union Development Agency-Nepad has now been completed, with full mandate to implement the continental agenda on infrastructure," AU Commission chair Moussa Faki Mahamat said in a statement. “Your role in this journey, Excellency, has been invaluable. Allow me to express my profound gratitude for accepting to serve in this role during the transition period, which has now come to a happy conclusion,”  Mr Mahamat added.
