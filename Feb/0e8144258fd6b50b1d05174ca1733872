FILE PHOTO | PHOEBE OKALL | NMG The High Court has dismissed a petition by former students of the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agricultural Technology (Jkuat) seeking the reopening of the institution’s Eldoret campus that was shut down three years ago. Justice Reuben Nyakundi ruled that the students failed to demonstrate that the decision to close the campus in 2020 was unlawful or malicious.

They said that they had paid fees and had a legitimate expectation that the university would offer quality education at the campus, but that it was arbitrarily closed taking into account the views of the students. “In my view, the Applicants ought to have demonstrated to this Court that Respondents acted outside of the powers and mandate given to them under the Universities Act, or that they abused those powers in some way,” the judge said. The judge added that the larger purposive objective accompanied by public interest surpassed the expectation of the petitioners when the university closed the campus.
