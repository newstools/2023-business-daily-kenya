The lavish retirement benefits must be consistent with Kenya’s economic realities and not impose a heavy burden on taxpayers. The new administration has stated its preference for a slimmer government with reduced spending on perks, travel and hospitality that are impeding funding of development projects in Kenya, While we support the idea of State-funded perks and benefits for a retired president, we contend that the package being offered to Mr Kenyatta is exorbitant in a country mired in poverty and a double-digit unemployment rate. In any case, the former President is also hardly short of cash. The law sets a retired president’s monthly pension at 80 percent of the pensionable salary paid to a sitting president. An equivalent of Sh1.95 million monthly will be wired as pension to Mr Kenyatta’s bank accounts. Aside from the monthly pension, the former President is entitled to a golden handshake, a fleet of cars, which will include two limousines, tens of aides, and a fully furnished office block. We believe Sh100 million per annum is enough for these extra benefits based on what the Treasury paid former presidents. Large pension payments, which also apply to other retired high-ranking public officials, also frustrate the Treasury’s efforts to cut down the public sector wage bill. It may therefore be necessary to review the pension policy for all officials with a view to moderating what the public pays for their upkeep in retirement.
