The Kenya National Qualifications Authority (KNQA) says it is developing a differentiated unit cost policy to articulate the cost of conducting the assessment on artisans. Already, tailors, hairdressers and welders, among others, opt for the informal sector because of fewer job opportunities in the formal sector. The RPL programme aims to make formal employment accessible to people who have gained knowledge and skills through informal training or experiential means. A steep fee to recognise their skills will discourage them, killing the programme meant to mainstream the informal sector. We urge the State to bring the cost down lower than the Sh25,000 set for the pilot phase. The high cost of certification and education locks out millions of children from low-income households from accessing opportunities. If implemented well and at an affordable fee for all artisans, KNQA will be able to register higher numbers that can help bring down the high cost of the exercise.
