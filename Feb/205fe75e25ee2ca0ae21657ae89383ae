Embrace debt resolution under the Insolvency Act. FILE PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK The drop in bankruptcy applications in Kenya to a five-year low is good news. It signals a recovering economy, albeit marginal, and that the introduction of the Insolvency Act in Kenya in 2015 is paying off. Struggling companies are no longer hastily wound up for the benefit of creditors, but they are first steered back to profitability and then handed over to the directors. Restrictions imposed on bankrupt individuals have also proved to be a deterrent to the filing of similar applications, contributing to the fall in applications. Data from the Office of the Official Receiver, a department of the Business Registration Services, shows that 16 bankruptcy applications were filed during the fiscal year that ended June 2022, down from 21 in the previous period. Voluntary bankruptcy applications by debt-distressed individuals dropped to 11 from 21. Hopefully, debt resolution will continue on this trajectory. Improving the survival chances of businesses is more pressing and it will entice investors to provide additional liquidity to those in distress.
