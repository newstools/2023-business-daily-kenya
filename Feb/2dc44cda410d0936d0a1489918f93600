FILE PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK Kenyan landlords with properties listed on the short-term house rental platform Airbnb made Sh38,638.6 ($308) on average in the month of December attributed to higher bookings during the festive season and increased daily charges per night. Data from vacation rental research firm AirDNA shows the revenue grew from an average of Sh25,647 ($206) in October when the occupancy rate was at 19 per cent, to a rate of 33 per cent in December. The 14 percentage points increase in the two months was aided by higher bookings during the festive season as more people celebrated the holidays away from their homes. The rise signals increased travel and spending by Kenyans and foreigners during the Christmas holidays. The average daily cost of leasing Nairobi homes through the short-term house rental platform Airbnb rose from $44 (Sh5,461.7) in September to more than $45 (Sh5,602.5) in December. The charges represent the average cost of nightly bookings plus cleaning fees. “The median monthly revenue (nightly rate and cleaning fees) earned over the past 12 months. This revenue figure represents the past 12 months and does not include taxes, service fees or additional guest fees,” added AirDNA.
