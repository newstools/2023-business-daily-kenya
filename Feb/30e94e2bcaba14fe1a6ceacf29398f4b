Find quick ways to reduce tax refunds. ILLUSTRATION | SHUTTERSTOCK If manufacturing companies in Kenya have failed to create decent jobs despite years of receiving tax incentives, then it is time to re-evaluate these policies. For many years, the government has imposed steep duties on iron and steel, vegetable oils, paper and paper products, timber and furniture, and textile and footwear, to help the manufacturing sector generate decent jobs. But since 2018, statistics show, these sub-sectors have barely generated new jobs. If the tax incentives are not paying off in real economic gains and fail to produce the jobs that were promised, let there be a rigorous policy review targeting particular sectors or types of firms. The government must not persist with the incentives yet they have failed to yield results of increasing jobs that Kenyans so needed, especially the youth. Data shows wage employment in the manufacturing sector has dropped from 343,719 in 2017 to 336,835 two years ago, despite some of the players being shielded from the competition. If some incentives are to remain, let them be reviewed year after year.
