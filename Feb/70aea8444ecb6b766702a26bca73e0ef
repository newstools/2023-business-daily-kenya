Find quick ways to reduce tax refunds. ILLUSTRATION | SHUTTERSTOCK A new report indicates that tax refunds went up to Sh316 billion in the financial year ending June 2021, from the Sh267 billion paid out in the previous year. The increase in tax reliefs came in the wake of the governmentâ€™s determination to get rid of unnecessary waivers. Granted, tax exemptions can positively impact the economy if applied appropriately. They can play a vital role such as reducing the cost of key commodities like fuel and boosting the supply of certain crucial goods. However, tax exemptions can also be a drag on the economy when they fail to meet the intended objectives. National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung'u says the chunk of the tax incentives have not only failed to have the envisaged impact, they have even made the tax system inefficient and difficult to administer. It is, therefore, time to re-look at and streamline these incentives, especially now when the country needs every cent to address the myriad of challenges it faces. The tax reliefs that have not served their purpose should be eliminated forthwith.
