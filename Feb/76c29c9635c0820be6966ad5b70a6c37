The microfinance cut its interest rate to eight percent in December 2021, down from the 21 percent it was charging, saving farmers Sh500 million during the period, the lender said.

The money is now being retained by the tea grower, and this is the right way of supporting them,” Greenland Fedha chairman Chege Kirundi said Tuesday.

Mr Kirundi said growers apply, receive and repay their loans through their mobile wallets. “We are digitally enabled, and farmers have realised that the system is convenient and cheap,” he added. The chairman said they have about 650,000 growers as customers. “Out of 650,000, not everyone has borrowed, and we are trying to enrich and extend our services to all of them,” he said. The growers borrow for projects, paying schools fees and meeting their daily needs.
