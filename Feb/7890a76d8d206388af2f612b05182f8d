In Kenya, weight-loss drugs sold in the black market are turning traders into millionaires. FILE PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK Revelations that many Kenyans are turning to weight-loss drugs sold in the black market should concern us all. A black market for commodities as sensitive as drugs should worry policymakers given that it poses a health risk to the users, many of who do not even know they are consuming drugs that have not been cleared by the regulator. Surveillance bodies such as Pharmacy and Poisons Board should step up their checks to protect the public from the lurking danger. From pharmaceutical companies to downtown traders and online sellers, the race to get a slice of the obesity market is cutthroat. But it is the consumers who are at risk. For instance, the sale of obesity pills called Sibutramine, used for short and long-term therapy obesity is being sold through digital platforms such as Instagram despite having been banned for use in the US in 2010 because of an increased risk of a heart attack. Many others, trading under different brands, are being sold to unsuspecting users in the race to cut weight. Pharmacy and Poisons Board should scale up its surveillance beyond just raids on physical pharmacies if they are to rescue consumers.
