FILE PHOTO | NMG The move by the competition watchdog in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) to force e-commerce firm Jumia liable for the safety and quality of products sold on its platform is commendable. It will protect consumers who have in the past complained about receiving low-quality products from e-commerce websites, including Jumia. The Comesa Competition Commission's settlement could also force Jumia to recall defective and unsafe products sold by third-party agents. The enforcement should be extended to other platforms that sell products online. The Comesa market should not be treated as dumping grounds for low quality products and counterfeits. Product liability cases have dogged e-commerce firms in recent years as they turned their stores into an online bazaar fuelled by millions of third-party vendors. The e-commerce firms have always held that they are not legally responsible for defective products sold by third-party merchants on their sites. This cannot suffice because buyers make their purchases based on the credibility of the platforms. It is our view that these firms have a direct responsibility to protect customers from third party vendors with sub-standard products. The Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) should take cue from the regional watchdog and move with speed to protect consumers. Cases of buyers receiving products that are not of the same quality listed on e-commerce websites have been on the rise.
