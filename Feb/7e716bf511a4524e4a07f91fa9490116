The ongoing dispute between the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK) and the trustees of its pension scheme over unremitted dues is a case in point. Such tussles tend to run for years, and in the meantime, long-suffering pensioners are kept waiting for their rightful dues. From the many examples of pending payments by institutions such as public universities, counties and public hospitals, it is clear that a lasting solution needs to be found over these remittances. Some of the institutions that are sitting on billions of shillings of pensioners' funds are in the meantime rolling out large projects and incurring other recurrent spending, clearly showing that pension dues are not at the top of their list of priorities. This need not be the case. These entities should now be required to issue a plan detailing how they intend to settle the pension dues. For those that receive funding from the public purse, failure to do so should see the Exchequer retain some of their allocations for servicing this overdue debt.
