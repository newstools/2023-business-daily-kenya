The multi-modal facility, which will be developed by British architects, will be situated within a 425-acre land piece, of which Kenya Railways owns 292 acres. Kenya Railways Managing Director Mr Phillip Mainga said that the overall scope of phase one of the early works that have commenced covers the construction of a pedestrian footbridge across the Nairobi Railway Yard, construction of a new Nairobi Central Railway station and a public square. The works also include hoarding and securing of the railway station and public park site, detailed drainage overhaul within the Nairobi Railway yard, construction of a new structural steel Locomotive shed at the Makadara Yard and relocation of the existing shed at Nairobi Yard, as well as the paving of Kenya Railways Headquarters driveway and car park.
