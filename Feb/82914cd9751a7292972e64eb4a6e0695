The Employment Court has suspended the replacement of the chairperson of the board of directors of the Kenya National Trading Corporation Captain Paul Rukaria. FILE PHOTO | COURTESY The Employment Court has suspended the replacement of chairperson of the board of directors of the Kenya National Trading Corporation Captain Paul Rukaria, pending determination of a case he has filed challenging his ouster. Justice James Rika also suspended appointment of Mr Hussein Tene Debasso, who was named by President William Ruto to replace Captain Rukaria, through a Kenya Gazette Notice on February 6. The decision is likely to have far-reaching consequences given that President Ruto’s government has made over 100 replacements since coming into office, in a move seen as a purge on former allies of his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta. “Pending the hearing of the application inter-parties, the respondents and their agents, representatives, employees or anyone else under their direction, are barred from effecting the gazette notice, which purports to de-gazette the petitioner herein as the chairperson of the Board of directors of the Kenya national Trading Corporation,” said the court. Among the appointments made by President Ruto are replacement of Mary Chao Mwadime with Daniel Rono as the chairperson of the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) for a period of three years. Ms Mwadime was appointed as the chairperson of Kemsa in April 2021 by President Kenyatta and her term was yet to expire. President Ruto also revoked the appointment of Linus Gitahi as the chairperson of the Rivatex East Africa Limited Board of Directors and replaced him with Cleophas Lagat. Others who have been pushed out include the Kenya Vision 2030 Delivery Board chairperson Caroline Kariuki, who was replaced by former Nambale Member of Parliament (MP) Sakwa Bunyasi, who will serve as Vision 2030 chairperson for three years. → skiplagat@ke.nationmedia.com
