The Treasury has so far spent Sh8.7 billion of the money to compensate oil dealers for keeping pump prices low in the period and is yet to pay an estimated Sh50 billion to dealers. Motorists pay Sh5.40 per litre each for diesel and petrol for the levy that was increased from Sh0.40 in July 2020, reflecting a 1,250 percent jump.
