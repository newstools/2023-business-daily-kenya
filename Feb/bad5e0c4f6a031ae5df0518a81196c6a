For 200kWh, consumers are coughing up Sh5,125.8 this month, a decline from Sh5,278.44 last month. The cost of electricity has fluctuated for six months in a row on the back of high oil prices and a weak shilling since the new administration took over. In September, after the elections, the cost of power was a high of Sh25.2 per kWh, followed by Sh25.67 per kWh in October; November was Sh24.74 per kWh and December at Sh26.29 per kWh. January saw Kenyans pay the most expensive domestic bills at Sh26.39 per kWh, adding to the burden of the high cost of living as people were saddled with unemployment and high inflation. Kenya's inflation dipped to nine percent year-on-year in January, down from 9.1 percent a month earlier, easing for the third month in a row on lower food and fuel prices. The FCC, FERFA and VAT variables decreased by 8.9 percent, 4.3 percent and 2.9 percent last month. The foreign exchange effect fell to Sh1.85 per kWh from Sh1.93 per kWh in the period under review. FCC in February was recorded as Sh7.18 per kWh down from Sh6.59 per kWh last month.
