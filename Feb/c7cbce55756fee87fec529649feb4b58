Regime changes tend to lead to delays in deals as experienced in the US when there was a year-and-a-half hiatus after President Joe Biden took over. Now it is time to hasten the negotiations. The US is a critical trading partner. The two countries agreed on the 11 pillars of the proposed trade deal. The US-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership, launched by the Biden administration, will replace the two-decade-old Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa). The current Agoa deal, a preferential trade programme that allows duty- and quota-free access to the US market for sub-Saharan African countries, will expire in September 2025. Agoa expiry clause has derailed long-term investments in Kenya and hopefully, the new deal will boost investments and also exports to the US. The two countries should now develop a roadmap for the final deal to hasten agricultural trade, spur the digital economy, and integrate micro, small, and medium enterprises into international trade, a sector that is a key driver of the economy.
