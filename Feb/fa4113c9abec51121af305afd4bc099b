Rethink water levy hike in power bills. FILE PHOTO | NMG The latest push by the water regulatory agency to have its share of the billions of shillings from electricity increased is fraught with risks to consumers and the country's manufacturing competitiveness. Whereas the Water Resources and Management Authority (Warma) has the right to raise funds for its operations, asking for review of the levy to Sh2 per unit of power, from the current Sh0.01 per unit will significantly increase the cost to both manufacturers and consumers. A glance at a power bill reveals a long list of deductions, leaving the consumer with very little of the entire purchase. A higher Warma charge will further squeeze households and families that are also staring at higher tariffs effective April if the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) approves the application made by Kenya Power on behalf of other State agencies in the energy agencies. Coming at a time when Kenyans are shouldering a heavy burden in electricity charges, Warma should look at the implications that extra charges will have on the countryâ€™s economy and household budgets.
