Times Tower in Nairobi, the headquarters of Kenya Revenue Authority. PHOTO | NMG With Sh9 billion in the government coffers, the Kenya Revenue Authorityâ€™s (KRA) tax amnesty initiative is a success story and proof that the carrot yields more results than the stick. The taxman netted the amount in the just-ended second phase of the Voluntary Tax Declaration Programme from 1,806 taxpayers, 752 more than the participants in the previous period. And the volunteers were spread across the taxpayer categories, signalling the huge appetite among Kenyans to meet their tax obligations provided that they have a caring partner. It is precisely because the KRA has worked hard to portray the image of a caring service provider, that Kenyans are comfortable approaching it to strike payment deals. However, for greater compliance, the taxman, policy and lawmakers and other stakeholders need to simplify tax laws that leave most of the population at a disadvantage. If everyone understood what the law requires of them and the benefits they stand to gain, then they would take ownership. As it is, even the most educated Kenyans have to hire tax experts to ensure they are up to date with their tax payments, if anything, to avoid the heavy penalties that non-compliance attracts.
