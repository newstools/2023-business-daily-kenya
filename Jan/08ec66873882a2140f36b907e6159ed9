The maker of beauty products, including creams, nail polish, lotions and moisturisers blamed the increase in raw material prices, inflation and depreciation of local currencies against the US dollar for its expected drop in earnings.

The Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm cited the sharp increase in raw material prices, especially plastics which are the main driver of its cost of sales. The company blamed global supply chain disruptions that have seen shipping costs triple over the past 12 months, hurting business. The shilling depreciated from Sh106 for every dollar in June 2021 to Sh124 end of this month.
