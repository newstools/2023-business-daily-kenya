The programme will allow customers to access digital mental assessments (psychometrics) and wellness and life coaching sessions, including chronic disease management and professional counselling. Customers will access the services under three packages designed by Jubilee Health, with the annual cost ranging between Sh13,000 and Sh39,000. “Our partnership with Chiromo Hospital Group is driven by our shared purpose to offer practical and accessible solutions that enable individuals to prevent, treat and manage mental health conditions,” said Jubilee Health Insurance chief executive Njeri Jomo. The mental health cover targets both existing Jubilee Health customers and non-customers. It is an additional service to existing customers’ medical policies allowing them to access mental health services from Chiromo. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), depression and anxiety have a significant economic impact, with the estimated cost to the global economy being $1 trillion per year in lost productivity. Although treatment for mental health has increasingly become available, there is still a huge disparity in access and affordability. “As a result of our partnership with Jubilee Health Insurance, we have designed a solution that will empower individuals by providing a holistic approach to mental health treatment and management,” said Chiromo Hospital Group founder Dr Frank Njenga. Jubilee Insurance Group chief executive Dr Julius Kipngetich reiterated that the partnership was in line with the insurer’s commitment to advocate for wellness and provide suitable health interventions for people across all demographics. → ligadwah@ke.nationmedia.com
