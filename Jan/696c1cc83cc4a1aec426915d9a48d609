The cash call opened on December 29 and was to run until January 23, with the investment firm seeking to recapitalise the business and reduce debt.

Proceeds from the rights issue will reduce its indebted shareholders like Kuramo Capital and other lenders, including Equity Bank. The rights issue price was set at Sh1.1 per unit, representing a small discount on the share’s prevailing trading price of Sh1.3 at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) as of the close of trading on Monday.
