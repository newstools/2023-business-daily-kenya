Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu’s audit of the State House Mortgage Scheme Fund revealed that the loans due from the officers were not being serviced with arrears amounting to Sh15.6 million. Further, Ms Gathungu casts doubts on the recoverability of the funds, saying she found no evidence of measures being taken by the management to recover the loans. The State rolled out the scheme in 2015 to attract and retain top talent in the face of increasing competition from the private sector. The top beneficiaries of the cheap housing loans are Cabinet secretaries, governors, the Attorney General, the Secretary to the Cabinet and the Chief of Defence Forces, each entitled to a house loan of up to Sh40 million. This begs several questions. Are these highly-paid officials taking advantage of their positions and exploiting loopholes to the detriment of the good intentions of the fund? Why are there no recovery efforts? Could this be the fate of similar schemes rolled out for other civil servants? The fund managers must develop sound strategies for recovering the hard-earned taxpayers’ money without fear or intimidation.
