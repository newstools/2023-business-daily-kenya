Among other areas, the expected extras will go towards paying salaries and wages plus what is only categorised as “others”. What is worrying is that this increase is higher than the Sh50.3 billion that is expected to come from taxes, levies, rent of buildings, fines and forfeitures. It, therefore, means that the rise could hit, among other things, the development expenditure, which is what should worry the government more than the regulars such as wages. Over the years, the wages bulge has given the government more painful headache than some of the key essentials just in the quest for growing the perennially elusive development expenditure that delivers dignity. As a matter of fact, the William Ruto administration whose anchor call on the economy is to uplift the lowly christened hustlers should be more worried about the rank and file than cronies whose jobs will grow the wage bill. It is disturbing that this has ended up with more principal secretaries and was planning to hire chief administrative secretaries against the furore that this office is unnecessary. While the President has asked the Treasury to reduce the recurrent budget by Sh300 billion, it would be meaningless to end up with a structure that demands more budget at a time debt is giving Kenyans sleepless nights. Reducing wastage, corruption and working with a leaner civil service are some of the bold steps to deliver firm growth and dignity
