Lake Victoria Tourism Association chairman Robinson Anyal is upbeat. “Most of the hotels have recorded full bookings during the period,” he told the Business Daily. While January was expected to be a low season after the Christmas and New Year festivities, Mr Anyal said the tournament has extended good tidings for players in the hospitality industry. Those operating serviced apartments and homestays have also not been left behind with most operators reporting increased bookings. “Out of my five units, three of them have already been booked for the entire one week that the event is scheduled to take place,” said James Ochieng. Due to its proximity to the city, industry players from the neighbouring county of Vihiga also expect to get a piece of the pie.
