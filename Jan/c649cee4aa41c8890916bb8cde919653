The government in August launched new digital number plates and directed motorists to apply for them or risk legal penalties. The State agencies involved should fast-track the implementation of the microchip-embedded number plates. The digital number plates will earn the Treasury more than Sh12 billion in application fees, curb the duplication that criminals and tax evaders use, help track traffic rule offenders and trace stolen vehicles, among other benefits for the State and motorists.
