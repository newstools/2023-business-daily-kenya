Protect the economy from more slowdown. PHOTO | POOL The economy slowed for the fifth consecutive quarter on the back of below-average rainfall, elevated inflationary pressures and August poll angst. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data shows that the pace of growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — a measure of national economic output — shrunk by nearly half to 4.7 per cent in the third quarter ended September from 9.3 per cent in a similar period last year. The latest GDP numbers show Kenya’s economy expanded at a slower pace compared to 5.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2022, 6.8 per cent (first quarter of 2022), 7.4 per cent (fourth quarter of 2021) and 9.3 per cent (third quarter of 2021). The majority of the reasons for this softer performance are predictable and can be mitigated – including the prolonged dry weather conditions and high cost of inputs hurt agricultural production that combined with runaway inflation and weaker shilling eroded consumer purchasing power and reduced demand for goods and services. One of the sectors that need a quick fix is agriculture — which accounts for more than a fifth of Kenya’s GDP and has continued to contract, affecting job creation and other sectors such as manufacturing. Together with this, the Central Bank of Kenya and other actors must find solutions to deal with the depreciation of the shilling, the runaway inflation, the widening balance of trade and the debt headache that continues to put pressure on the economy. The International Monetary Fund has warned that nearly a third of the global economy will be in recession in 2023, and Kenya cannot wait to be a victim of the turbulence in the big economies.
