Data from the Ministry of Education shows an additional 27,569 candidates scored C+ and above, bringing the total to 173,345, compared to 145,776 recorded the previous year. The performance rise could trigger a scramble for top courses like medicine, dental surgery, civil engineering, information technology and architecture that offer hopes jobs in the saturated market. Liberal arts and environmental courses are less preferred because candidates feel they are offered fewer openings in the job market. “The number of candidates with minimum university entry qualification of Grade C+ and above has risen to 173,345 in the year 2022 KCSE examination compared to 145,776 in 2021,” said Education Cabinet Secretary Ezekiel Machogu when he released the results on Friday.
