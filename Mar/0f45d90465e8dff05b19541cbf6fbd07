FILE PHOTO | NMG Multichoice Kenya plans to increase its pay TV charges by up to 10 percent starting April 1 in response to rising operational costs, the pay television company said on Thursday. The higher charges for its various bouquets will see adjustments of between six percent and 10 percent for both DStv and GOtv customers. However, some GOtv bouquets will remain unaffected by the price change. “MultiChoice acknowledges the difficult economic climate in Kenya and thus has kept the increase at the lowest possible point while ensuring sustainability and provision of quality services,” said Multichoice Kenya in a statement on Thursday. Customers on the DStv Premium tariff plan will pay Sh9,500 per month from the current Sh8,900, reflecting a 6.7 percent increase.
