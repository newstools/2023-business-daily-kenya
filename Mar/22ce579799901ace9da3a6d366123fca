FILE PHOTO | FRANCIS NDERITU | NMG The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) has extended the contract of its chief executive Geoffrey Odundo by one year to maintain continuity as it searches for a new leader. Mr Odundo was to leave the firm on February 28 when he had completed his second four-year term. The extension of his contract comes amid plans by the government to list five State-owned firms on the Nairobi bourse in the short term.

Mr Odundo was first appointed to helm the NSE on March 1, 2015, near the start of the long-term bear market that has gripped the bourse, influencing the performance of the company which earns fees on transactions. Business Daily has learned that concern over continuity at NSE prompted approval of the application for an extension of term for Mr Odundo, coming at a time when the Nairobi bourse has lost several key staff.
