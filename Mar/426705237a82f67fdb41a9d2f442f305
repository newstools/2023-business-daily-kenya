EACC told the court that on June 10, 2015, the officer was found in possession of unauthorised computer information belonging to the commission. The data was from a computer belonging to his colleague John Kiilu. He was suspected of unauthorised divulgence of investigation information. Though employees were not prohibited from sharing computers, the court heard that each staff had login credentials.

It added that Mr Rotich was reading high-profile cases handled by Mr Kiilu and that he had inserted a flash disk, intending to download the information.
