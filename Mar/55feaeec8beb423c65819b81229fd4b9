Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakango. FILE PHOTO | NMG The allegations that the Controller of Budget (CoB) was under duress to release Sh10 billion without Parliament approval four days before the last General Election should be investigated and officials involved punished. The Constitution put checks and balances to protect public funds from corrupt State officials. The revelations by the CoB are a breach of law and should not be taken lightly. The disclosures are contained in a tense WhatsApp chat between CoBMargaret Nyakang’o and former Treasury Cabinet secretary Ukur Yatani that was tabled on Monday in Parliament. The breach is also an indictment of the CoB’s office, which is mandated to oversee national and county governments’ spending and protect taxpayer funds from being plundered by those in positions of influence. That Dr Nyakang’o approved the release and is now alleging that she was under duress is dishonest and a betrayal of her oath of office. The Constitution gives her office the power to decline irregular payments and ensure that the law is followed in public spending. She should take some responsibility and resign or be removed from office.
