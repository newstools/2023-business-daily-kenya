FILE PHOTO | NMG Nearly half of the tea offered for sale at the auction by the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) was withdrawn from the trading floor in the latest auction as traders prioritise buying higher quality grades of the commodity. The Mombasa auction data indicates that 47 percent of the 129,198 packages that were offered for sale were withdrawn after they failed to attract buyers.

The government introduced a minimum price of $2.43 per kilo KTDA teas two years ago to cushion farmers from lower prices that had fallen below the cost of production. However, the minimum price is now impacting negatively on farmers with a lot of rejection witnessed at the auction. On the contrary, KTDA teas from the East of Rift region have been attracting good prices at the auction because of their high quality. Mr Kimanga said buyers have opted to buy other teas at $2.43 that are of higher quality compared to the ones that are being sold at this value. “Buyers cannot just pay higher prices to acquire any quality of tea. Because of the minimum price, they are selective about the teas that they pay for,” said the trader.
