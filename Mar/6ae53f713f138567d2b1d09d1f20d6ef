FILE PHOTO | KEVIN ODIT | NMG Base Titanium has started ore extraction at its new site in Kwale, which is expected to extend the life of its mines until the end of next year. Its Australian-based parent firm – Base Resources — said in a trading update that mining at the new site, known as Bumamani, commenced in late February as planned. The new mining area, which covers the Kwale North Dune, is expected to yield up to 17.9 million tonnes of titanium ore, out of which the firm expects to get 42,000 tonnes of rutile, 171,000 tonnes of ilmenite and 20,000 tonnes of zircon.

In the three months to September 2022, it spent Sh1.17 billion ($9.2 million) on preparatory work, land and equipment acquisition for the site. Base Titanium’s push for new mining sites in Kwale, as well as exploratory work further afield in northern Tanzania, comes at a time when higher global titanium prices have raised its earnings to a record high. In the six months to December 2022, the miner’s Kenya operation realised revenue of $126.6 million (Sh16.03 billion), driven by a 32 percent jump in the sales price of its product in the market compared to the corresponding period in 2021. It produced 38,384 tonnes of rutile, 170,771 tonnes of ilmenite, 14,043 tonnes of zircon and a combined 9,228 tonnes of low-grade rutile and zircon products in the half-year period.
