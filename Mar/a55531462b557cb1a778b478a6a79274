Education Cabinet Secretary, Ezekiel Machogu. FILE PHOTO | NMG Meru University of Science and Technology (MUST) council has been ordered to reinstate vice chancellor Romanus Odhiambo and revoke the appointment of Charity Gichuki to the position in an acting capacity. Education Cabinet secretary Ezekiel Machogu termed the council’s decision unlawful and ill-timed since it was made days before the graduation ceremony scheduled for March 11. The university senate in a memo on Monday resolved to close the institution indefinitely following students’ unrest triggered by the sacking of Prof Odhiambo.

The university council declined to renew Prof Odhiambo’s contract due to expire in July this year for a second term and instead sent him on “accumulated annual leave”. The CS directed the university management to facilitate the reopening of the institution for the return of students and the resumption of normal operations no later than Wednesday. In the memo, the university management stated that the 10th graduation ceremony, which was scheduled for Saturday had been suspended until further notice.
