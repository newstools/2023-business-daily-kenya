NMG PHOTO The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) has written to the Public Service Commission (PSC) seeking information on the establishment of the Office of Spouse of the Prime Cabinet Secretary. The office CS’s wife Tessie Mudavadi was launched last week to allegedly complement the work being done by the Office of the First Lady Rachael Ruto and the Office of the Spouse to Deputy President Dorcas Gachagua. Article 234 of the Constitution, the PSC may establish an office in the public service, and the LSK wants to be furnished with information regarding the legal framework that guides its establishment, the financial implications of setting up the office and the benefits that shall accrue to the members of the public as a result of the establishment of the office. “Kindly, supply us with the information stated above within the next Seven (7) days to enable us to interrogate the same and satisfy ourselves as to the legality of the establishment of the office,” the LSK said through its President Eric Theuri. Mr Theuri said the LSK will move to court and challenge the establishment of the office if the information sought is not made available within one week. Ms Mudavadi said during the launch that she will work with other organisations to empower Kenyans and individuals, especially in improving the lives of children and families. She added that it was high time that the spouses of the top leaders in the country, use their position to uplift and support the less fortunate in society. “I believe that when we work to create a difference in society and be able to uplift those who are unable to uplift themselves, we collectively light our own way and make an expression of our highest achievement,” she said. → skiplagat@ke.nationmedia.com
