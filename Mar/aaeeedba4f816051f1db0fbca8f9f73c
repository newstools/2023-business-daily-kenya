The revelation was made when Treasury Cabinet Secretary Prof Njuguna Ndung’u and EIB Vice President Thomas Östros signed a joint declaration on renewable hydrogen. The bank earlier held discussions on green hydrogen with President William Ruto. “Kenya has some of the best renewable energy sources in the world if the storage components were equally developed. The route to storage has the potential to develop green hydrogen to deliver sustainable, green and inclusive growth,” said Prof Ndung’u.
