Transport Principal Secretary Mohamed Daghar said the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) Act and the Traffic Act contain sufficient laws to regulate the operations of two- and three-wheelers. Read: Boda bodas increase 53pc in five years The NTSA (Amendment) Bill, 2022 seeks to assign additional functions to the authority including establishing procedures for registration and licensing. “Section 4(2)(a) of the NTSA Act empowers the authority to undertake the registration of all motor vehicles including two and three-wheeled motorcycle taxis,” Mr Daghar told MPs. “The Authority does not support the amendments. The purpose of the amendment is therefore already contained in the law.” The Bill, sponsored by Ruiru MP Simon King’ara, sought to compel riders of boda to acquire a Public Service Vehicle badge and licences from the NTSA. The Bill provides that two- and three-wheel taxis be regulated by the transport authority.

The NTSA and county governments will be required to register riders and drivers of the taxis. → emutai@ke.nationmedia.com
