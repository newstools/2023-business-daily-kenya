Malaysian investors on Monday held a trade forum with Kenyan businesses with sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing as having the potential for joint ventures and public-private partnerships (PPPs). “We want to see increased exports to Malaysia and narrow the trade deficit between Kenya and Malaysia. We are looking at partnering with Malaysian firms to help us increase exports to their market as well as Africa,” said Richard Ngatia, the president of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI).
