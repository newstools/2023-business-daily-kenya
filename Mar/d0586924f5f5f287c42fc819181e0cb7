Premier Bank Limited (Somalia) has received approval from the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) to acquire a 62.5 percent stake in FCB in a deal whose value is yet to be made public. “Pursuant to the provisions of section 46 (6) (a) (ii) of the Competition Act, 2010, it is notified for general information that in exercise of the powers conferred upon the CAK by section 46 (1) of the Competition Act, the CAK has authorised the implementation of the proposed merger as set out herein,” said Adano Wario, acting Director-General at CAK. The deal, which will require Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) approval, will help support FCB, whose core capital had dropped to Sh924 million against the required minimum of Sh1 billion. The reduced capital left FCB’s core capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio at 7.1 percent compared to the required minimum of 10.5 percent. The total capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio was at 11 percent against the allowed minimum of 14.5 percent. READ: First Community in crisis as 'hitch' sparks bank run Premier Bank is a privately-owned Sharia-compliant commercial bank incorporated in Somalia in 2013 and licensed by the Central Bank of Somalia in 2014, making it a match for FCB. FCB received a CBK licence in 2007 and commenced official operations on June 1, 2008, as the first fully-fledged Shariah-compliant bank in Kenya. The lender was in October last year faced with a bank run triggered by what it said was a system hitch that hit its operations. Customers who lined up to draw their cash claimed the bank was only permitting withdrawals of less than Sh10,000 a day and had placed curbs on cheque clearance. The bank’s problems became public after it said it was experiencing system disruptions that affected most of its services, creating a backlog. This triggered panic withdrawals raising fears that it was headed for a bank run.

FCB’s nine-month profit to September 2022 dropped from Sh224 million to Sh205.67 million as operating expenses shot up. The past 10 years have witnessed a rise in bank deals in the Kenyan market, with CBK supporting the move as a way of injecting stability.
