A tribunal has recommended dismissal of IEBC Commissioner Irene Masit. PHOTO | WACHIRA MWANGI | NMG President William Ruto has sacked embattled Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) commissioner Irene Masit after a tribunal recommended her removal for gross misconduct. Ms Masit, who was on suspension, was one of four commissioners who rejected last year’s presidential election results. “I, William Samoei Ruto, in exercise of authority vested by Article 251(6) of the Constitution, do hereby direct that; the appointment and tenure of Irene Cherop Masit as a member of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission be and is terminated with immediate effect,” reads a gazette notice on Wednesday. The President said the recommendations of the Justice Aggrey Muchelule -led tribunal are binding on him. Three other commissioners --Juliana Cherera (former vice chairperson), Francis Wanderi and Justus Nyang’aya -- opted to resign than face the tribunal. The four, infamously referred to as the ‘Cherera four’, rejected the presidential election outcome saying it was arrived at by the electoral body chairman Wafula Chebukati in an opaque manner. Masit’s exit leaves the seven-member electoral commission without any commissioner as Mr Chebukati and two other commissioners --Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye-- retired on February 14 after the end of their tenures. → kmwangi@ke.nationmedia.com
