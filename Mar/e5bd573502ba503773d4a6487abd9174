Principal Secretary (PS) in the State department Shadrack Mwadime said the academy will introduce two new courses --Advanced Fire Fighting Centre and Survival Training Centre-- to make its cadets more competitive. “We are seeking an additional allocation of Sh19.8 billion from the National Treasury to support a 10-year master plan for expansion of the academy to upgrade it into a world-class academy as demand for cadets from the shipping school increases,” he said in Mombasa on Thursday. BMA was revived in 2019 to address challenges and meet growing skill demands for the maritime sector and the blue economy. The Blue Economy has been identified as an important sector in the growth and development of the Kenyan economy. → akitimo@ke.nationmedia.com
